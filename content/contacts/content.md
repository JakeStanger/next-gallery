Thank you for looking at my website.

I have spent most of my life either in the countryside or beside the sea, and I am passionate about both. 
For over twenty years I worked alongside anglers at a Site of Special Scientific Interest at Fordwich, 
as well as several other fabulous venues in the Kent countryside. 
I have also fished commercially off the Kent coast for bass for several years out of my own boat (rod and line).

I am fortunate enough now to have enough time to pursue photography and art which I can combine with my love of the outdoor life. 
I enjoy landscape photography, with the early mornings when no one is about my favourite time, 
along with astro-photography which gives me a real buzz; I love the atmosphere and peace that only the small hours can give. 
I am based just outside Canterbury and lucky enough to be surrounded by beautiful rural countryside as well as a close distance to the sea.
